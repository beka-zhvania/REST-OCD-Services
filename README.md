OCD Service - WebOCD

This is a RESTful web service for overlapping community detection. The service is developed with the Eclipse IDE and IntelliJ, so we recommend you to use one of these tools to work on the project.
WebOCD works best with the corresponding web client which you can find at https://github.com/rwth-acis/OCD-Web-Client

A running instance of WebOCD can be found at http://webocd.dbis.rwth-aachen.de/OCDWebClient/

For any information on the service itself please refer to the project wiki at

This service is based on the LAS2peer Template Project and its underlying LAS2peer framework. For any information on these please refer to
