# Guide for Using Custom GPT in Test Generation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for utilizing custom GPT models for the automatic generation of tests within the framework. If any questions arise, please reach out via the Rocket.Chat channel of DBIS.

## Graph Type Related Tests

**Step 1: Initialize Test Class**
- **Command**: `gradle runInitializeGraphTypeTestRelatedFiles -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: This task generates a test class for the specified algorithm and integrates interface implementations based on the compatible graph types. The new test class will be located at `rest_ocd_services/src/test/java/i5/las2peer/services/ocd/algorithms`. If the class already exists, it will be overwritten only if it is empty. GPT-generated tests that pass validation are added to this class. Additionally, copies of this class are made in `gpt/classfiles` to be used during the GPT-based test generation process and to serve as a reference for evaluating the generated code.

**Step 2: Construct GPT Prompt**
- **Command**: `gradle runGenerateAndWriteGraphTypeRelatedPromptByName -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: This command creates a prompt file in the `gpt/prompts` directory, which can be directly used as input for GPT. For optimal results, use a custom GPT model tailored for graph analysis frameworks. A supplementary file is also created in `gpt/unit_tests_unprocessed` for storing the unprocessed GPT response (GPT response should be copied here directly).

**Step 3: Evaluate GPT Response and Merge or Construct Issue Fixing Prompt**
- **Command**: `gradle runProcessGraphTypeRelatedGPTTestCode -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: This step involves extracting tests from the GPT response, evaluating them, and then either merging them into the main test class or creating a prompt to fix identified issues. If issues are found, a new prompt is generated in `gpt/prompts` for corrections. Repeat this step as needed until the response meets the required standards.

## OCDA Accuracy Tests

**Step 1: Generate OCDA Parameter Prompt**
- **Command**: `gradle runGenerateAndWriteOCDAParameterGenerationPromptByName -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: Generates a prompt for diverse OCDA parameter generation, located in `gpt/prompts`, and creates an empty file named `<AlgorithmName>_gpt_generated_ocda_parameters.txt` in `gpt/unit_tests_unprocessed` for the GPT's response.

**Step 2: Create OCDA Accuracy Test**
- **Command**: `gradle runGenerateAndWriteOCDAAccuracyTest -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: Utilizes the GPT response with parameters to create the OCDA accuracy test.

## Specific OCDA Method Tests

**Step 1: Initialize Test Files**
- **Command**: `gradle runInitializeOCDAMethodTestFiles -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> -PmethodNames=method1,method2 --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: Initializes required test files by specifying the algorithm name and method. This creates a test class in `gpt/classfiles` which will be used as input for GPT. The class is overwritten only if it is empty.

**Step 2: Construct GPT Prompt for OCDA Method Tests**
- **Command**: `gradle runGenerateAndWriteOCDAMethodTestPrompt -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> -PmethodNames=getMaxDifference --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: Generates a prompt file in the `gpt/prompts` directory for custom GPT and A supplementary file is also created in `gpt/unit_tests_unprocessed` for storing the unprocessed GPT response (GPT response should be copied here directly).

**Step 3: Evaluate GPT Response for OCDA Method Tests**
- **Command**: `gradle runProcessOCDAMethodRelatedGPTTestCode -PocdaName=<AlgorithmName> -PmethodNames=getMaxDifference --no-build-cache`
- **Description**: Analyzes the GPT-generated tests based on the specified algorithm and method, determining whether to merge them into the main test class or to create a new prompt for issue resolution.

**Note**: After each code evaluation step, a detailed report will be generated in `gpt/reports`, outlining the findings based on established quality metrics.

# Guide for Using Assistant GPT in Test Generation
In case of assistant GPT usage, users need to execute a python script while WebOCD is running and wait for the automatic integration of validated test results into the main test class.

**Graph Type Related Tests**:
- **Command**: `python ocda_test_generator.py generate_graph_type_related_tests <AlgorithmName>`

**OCDA Accuracy Tests**:
- **Command**: `python ocda_test_generator.py generate_diverse_ocda_parameters <AlgorithmName>`

**Specific OCDA Method Tests**:
- **Command**:  `python ocda_test_generator.py generate_specific_ocda_method_tests <AlgorithmName> --methodNames "method1,method2"`


The process with Assistant GPT does not require user interaction beyond the initial execution of the script. A markdown log file detailing the interaction will be generated in `gpt/logs` for user review.
