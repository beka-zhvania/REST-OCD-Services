# Cooperation Simulation

WebOCD allows you to run various cooperation simulation algorithms on the networks. To do so, you need to navigate to the [page](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/networks-covers-view#specific-network) of the desired network and click on the _Run Cooperation Simulation_ tab. Here you need to select the name, as well as the desired _game_, _dynamic_, and _break condition_ for the simulation.

In the example below, we choose __Snow Drift Game__, enter desired parameters and choose 5 iterations as input.

</p>

After we input all the parameters, we click on the &nbsp;  ![simulate-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/simulate_btn.png "Simulate Button") &nbsp; button to run the simulation.

To view all available simulation results, we click on the _Simulations_ button on the navbar.

# Simulation Groups

On the simulations page, you have the option to group simulations together. To do this you need to select the simulations you want in the group, as well as the group name. Then you need to click the ![group-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/group_btn.png "Cooperation Simulation Group") &nbsp; button. For example, below we group _Simulation-1_ and _Simulation-2_ in a group called _Sim-Tutorial-Group_.

To access all the groups, we click the ![simulation-groups-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/group_btn.png "Simulation Groups Button") &nbsp; button.

# Viewing Simulations

To view details about the simulation, you need to click on the name of the desired simulation. This is shown in the images below. Here we can see information about the simulation.

You can also view information about each iteration of the simulation.

# Centrality Simulation

Apart from running [centrality calculations](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/centrality), you can also run centrality simulations. To do so, you need to navigate to the page of some [specific cover](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/networks-covers-view#specific-cover). Here you can click _Run Centrality Simulation_ tab.

<p align="center">
    <img width="75%" height="auto" src="/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/run_centrality_simulation.png">
</p>

After selecting input parameters, you can click the &nbsp; ![run-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/run_btn.png "Run Button") &nbsp; button.

The results can be viewed similar to [cooperation simulation](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/cooperation-simulation).
