# Import

While you can generate networks and run various algorithms using WebOCD, you also have an option to import these things. To do so, you need to click on the import tab on the navbar.

Here you need to select what you want to import. You also need to specify the file you want to import and the name to call the improted item.

For whatever you are importing, you need to select from the available import formats. You also need to select the creation method for the imported graph or cover. Alternatively, you also have an option to choose _undefined_. Below you can see available import formats and creation types.

Once you select the inputs, click on the &nbsp; ![submit-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/submit_btn.png "Submit Button") &nbsp; button. This will import the selected item.
