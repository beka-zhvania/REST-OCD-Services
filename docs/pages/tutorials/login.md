# Login 

To use WebOCD you will need a Learning Layers account. However, if you do not have one don't worry: when you click on the login button you can create one without much of a hassle. All the generated and uploaded data can then only be accessed through this account!

The login process is visualized above. You start by clicking the login button, which will redirect you to a page that prompts you to enter your learning layers credentials. Once you click the signin button, if authentication is successful, you will be logged in and redirected to the _Network Analysis_ page of WebOCD.

# Network Analysis Page

After login, you land on the *Network Analysis*  page (see below). Here you can see all the running algorithms at that time. During initial login, this page should look as below and have no running algorithms.

From the *Network Analysis* page, as seen from the blue underline in the image above, you can use the navbar to access various pages for different WebOCD services. These include _Network, Community Detection, Benchmarks, Simulations, Centrality_. 

On the right upper corner (purple underline) you also have an option to go to an [import page](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/import), to e.g. import graphs/covers instead of generating them. As well as an option to log out.
